<p><font color="red">Note: Your profile doesn’t reflect videos you’ve removed from watch history or videos you’ve watched in a private window. Watch history is only available when you’re signed into YouTube.</font></p>
<p>
To view your time watched profile: 
<ol type="1">
<li>Sign into YouTube.</li>
<li>Tap your profile picture</li>
