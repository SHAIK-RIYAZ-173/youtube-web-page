<h1>Policy & claim basics</h1><br>
<h2>The features described in this article are available only to partners who use YouTube's Content ID matching system.
A policy is a set of rules that specify how a content owner wants YouTube to handle a claimed video. When you claim a video, you assert ownership over the content of the video, like the audio, visual, or audiovisual elements. Learn more about claims.

As an owner, you choose whether users can view the video and whether YouTube displays advertisements with the video. You say how you want YouTube to handle the video by associating a policy with it:

<p><font color="red">Monetize: Allow users to view the video and display advertisements with it.</font><p>
<div><font color="yellow">Track: Allow users to view the video without advertisements; collect statistics about video views.</font></div><br>
<font color="blue">Block: Don't allow users to view the video on YouTube.
If you select Monetize, claimed videos will be reviewed to ensure they meet our advertiser-friendly content guidelines before advertisements are displayed. This option authorizes YouTube to display advertisements with a claimed video, but it does not specify which types of advertisements YouTube displays. You can specify the types of advertisements using advertising settings.

<h1>Using policy rules</h1>
A user’s location is the most common condition for a policy rule, although other conditions are available for policies used with YouTube’s Content ID system. Learn more about usage policies and match policies.

YouTube recommends creating policies that apply worldwide. You should include territory rules in a policy only when you need to treat viewers differently within the territories where you own rights.

There are three predefined policies that you can use:
<ul type="square">
<li>Monetize in all countries</li>
<li>Track in all countries</li>
<li>Block in all countries</li>
</ul>
